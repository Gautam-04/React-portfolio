          Hi,
          <br />I am Gautam Rai, a second-year Computer Engineering student at
          Swami Vivekanand Societys Institute of Technology [Vesit] in Mumbai. I
          am an avid open-source contributor and a keen learner. I am always
          enthusiastic about collaborating with new people and seizing
          opportunities to interact with them. <br />
          In my pursuit of personal growth, I find solace in two activities:
          traveling and playing the guitar. Exploring new places helps me unwind
          and gain fresh perspectives, while strumming the guitar allows me to
          express myself creatively. Furthermore, reading books is a favorite
          pastime of mine during my leisure hours, as it not only expands my
          knowledge but also provides a means of relaxation.
        </p>
